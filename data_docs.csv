 Refugees and Asylum,http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/v1crs.htm,"  Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, 189 U.N.T.S. 150, entered into force April 22, 1954. PREAMBLE The High Contracting Parties, Considering that the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved on 10 December 1948 by the General Assembly have affirmed the principle that human beings shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination, Considering that the United Nations has, on various occasions, manifested its profound concern for refugees and endeavoured to assure refugees the widest possible exercise of these fundamental rights and freedoms, Considering that it is desirable to revise and consolidate previous international agreements relating to the status of refugees and to extend the scope of and the protection accorded by such instruments by means of a new agreement, Considering that the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries, and that a satisfactory solution of a problem of which the United Nations has recognized the international- scope and nature cannot therefore be achieved without international co-operation, Expressing the wish that all States, recognizing the social and humanitarian nature of the problem of refugees, will do everything within their power to prevent this problem from becoming a cause of tension between States, Noting that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is charged with the task of supervising international conventions providing for the protection of refugees, and recognizing that the effective co-ordination of measures taken to deal with this problem will depend upon the co-operation of States with the High Commissioner, Have agreed as follows: CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1. - Definition of the term ""refugee"" A. For the purposes of the present Convention, the term ""refugee,, shall apply to any person who: (1) Has been considered a refugee under the Arrangements of 12 May 1926 and 30 June 1928 or under the Conventions of 28 October 1933 and 10 February 1938, the Protocol of 14 September 1939 or the Constitution of the International Refugee Organization; Decisions of non-eligibility taken by the International Refugee Organization during the period of its activities shall not prevent the status of refugee being accorded to persons who fulfil the conditions of paragraph 2 of this section; (2) As a result of events occurring before I January 1951 and owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. In the case of a person who has more than one nationality, the term ""the country of his nationality"" shall mean each of the countries of which he is a national, and a person shall not be deemed to be lacking the protection of the country of his nationality if, without any valid reason based on well-founded fear, he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national. B. (1) For the purposes of this Convention, the words ""events occurring before I January 1951"" in article 1, section A, shall be understood to mean either (a) ""events occurring in Europe before I January 1951""; or (b) ""events occurring in Europe or elsewhere before I January 1951""; and each Contracting State shall make a declaration at the time of signature, ratification or accession, specifying which of these meanings it applies for the purpose of its obligations under this Convention. (2) Any Contracting State which has adopted alternative (a) may at any time extend its obligations by adopting alternative (b) by means of a notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. C. This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under the terms of section A if: (1) He has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; or (2) Having lost his nationality, he has voluntarily reacquired it; or (3) He has acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the protection of the country of his new nationality; or (4) He has voluntarily re-established himself in the country which he left or outside which he remained owing to fear of persecution; or (5) He can no longer, because the circumstances in connection with which he has been recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality; Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A (I) of this article who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to avail himself of the protection of the country of nationality; (6) Being a person who has no nationality he is, because the circumstances in connection with which he has been recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist, able to return to the country of his former habitual residence; Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a refugee falling under section A (I) of this article who is able to invoke compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution for refusing to return to the country of his former habitual residence. D. This Convention shall not apply to persons who are at present receiving from organs or agencies of the United Nations other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees protection or assistance. When such protection or assistance has ceased for any reason, without the position of such persons being definitively settled in accordance with the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, these persons shall ipso facto be entitled to the benefits of this Convention. E. This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country. F.

Article 5. - Rights granted apart from this Convention Nothing in this Convention shall be deemed to impair any rights and benefits granted by a Contracting State to refugees apart from this Convention. Article 6. - The term ""in the same circumstances"" For the purposes of this Convention, the term ""in the same circumstances"" implies that any requirements (including requirements as to length and conditions of sojourn or residence) which the particular individual would have to fulfil for the enjoyment of the right in question, if he were not a refugee, must be fulfilled by him, with the exception of requirements which by their nature a refugee is incapable of fulfilling. Article 7. - Exemption from reciprocity 1.

After a period of three years' residence, all refugees shall enjoy exemption from legislative reciprocity in the territory of the Contracting States. 3. Each Contracting State shall continue to accord to refugees the rights and benefits to which they were already entitled, in the absence of reciprocity, at the date of entry into force of this Convention for that State. 4.

Article 10. - Continuity of residence 1. Where a refugee has been forcibly displaced during the Second World War and removed to the territory of a Contracting State, and is resident there, the period of such enforced sojourn shall be considered to have been lawful residence within that territory. 2. Where a refugee has been forcibly displaced during the Second World War from the territory of a Contracting State and has, prior to the date of entry into force of this Convention, returned there for the purpose of taking up residence, the period of residence before and after such enforced displacement shall be regarded as one uninterrupted period for any purposes for which uninterrupted residence is required. Article 11. - Refugee seamen In the case of refugees regularly serving as crew members on board a ship flying the flag of a Contracting State, that State shall give sympathetic consideration to their establishment on its territory and the issue of travel documents to them or their temporary admission to its territory particularly with a view to facilitating their establishment in another country.

The personal status of a refugee shall be governed by the law of the country of his domicile or, if he has no domicile, by the law of the country of his residence. 2. Rights previously acquired by a refugee and dependent on personal status, more particularly rights attaching to marriage, shall be respected by a Contracting State, subject to compliance, if this be necessary, with the formalities required by the law of that State, provided that the right in question is one which would have been recognized by the law of that State had he not become a refugee.

CHAPTER V ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES Article 25. -Administrative assistance 1. When the exercise of a right by a refugee would normally require the assistance of authorities of a foreign country to whom he cannot have recourse, the Contracting States in whose territory he is residing shall arrange that such assistance be afforded to him by their own authorities or by an international authority. 2. The authority or authorities mentioned in paragraph 1 shall deliver or cause to be delivered under their supervision to refugees such documents or certifications as would normally be delivered to aliens by or through their national authorities. 3.

The benefit of the present provision may not, however, be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is, or who, having been convicted by a final judgement of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country. Article 34. - Naturalization The Contracting States shall as far as possible facilitate the assimilation and naturalization of refugees.

 Human Rights in the Administration of Justice ,http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/i1ccleo.htm," Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, G.A. res. 34/169, annex, 34 U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 46) at 186, U.N. Doc. A/34/46 (1979). Article 1 Law enforcement officials shall at all times fulfil the duty  imposed upon them by law, by serving the community and by protecting  all persons against illegal acts, consistent with the high degree  of responsibility required by their profession. Commentary: (a) The term ""law enforcement officials', includes all  officers of the law, whether appointed or elected, who exercise  police powers, especially the powers of arrest or detention. (b) In countries where police powers are exercised by military  authorities, whether uniformed or not, or by State security forces,  the definition of law enforcement officials shall be regarded  as including officers of such services. (c) Service to the community is intended to include particularly  the rendition of services of assistance to those members of the  community who by reason of personal, economic, social or other  emergencies are in need of immediate aid. (d) This provision is intended to cover not only all violent,  predatory and harmful acts, but extends to the full range of  prohibitions under penal statutes. It extends to conduct by persons  not capable of incurring criminal liability. Article 2 In the performance of their duty, law enforcement officials  shall respect and protect human dignity and maintain and uphold  the human rights of all persons. Commentary: (a) The human rights in question are identified and protected  by national and international law. Among the relevant international  instruments are the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Declaration  on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture  and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,  the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms  of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the  Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International  Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of  Apartheid, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of  the Crime of Genocide, the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment  of Prisoners and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. (b) National commentaries to this provision should indicate  regional or national provisions identifying and protecting these  rights. Article 3 Law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly  necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their  duty. Commentary: (a) This provision emphasizes that the use of force by law  enforcement officials should be exceptional; while it implies  that law enforcement officials may be authorized to use force  as is reasonably necessary under the circumstances for the prevention  of crime or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of  offenders or suspected offenders, no force going beyond that  may be used. (b) National law ordinarily restricts the use of force by  law enforcement officials in accordance with a principle of proportionality.  It is to be understood that such national principles of proportionality  are to be respected in the interpretation of this provision.  In no case should this provision be interpreted to authorize  the use of force which is disproportionate to the legitimate  objective to be achieved. (c) The use of firearms is considered an extreme measure.  Every effort should be made to exclude the use of firearms, especially  against children. In general, firearms should not be used except  when a suspected offender offers armed resistance or otherwise  jeopardizes the lives of others and less extreme measures are  not sufficient to restrain or apprehend the suspected offender.  In every instance in which a firearm is discharged, a report  should be made promptly to the competent authorities. Article 4 Matters of a confidential nature in the possession of law  enforcement officials shall be kept confidential , unless the  performance of duty or the needs of justice strictly require  otherwise. Commentary: By the nature of their duties, law enforcement officials obtain  information which may relate to private lives or be potentially  harmful to the interests, and especially the reputation, of others.  Great care should be exercised in safeguarding and using such  information, which should be disclosed only in the performance  of duty or to serve the needs of justice. Any disclosure of such  information for other purposes is wholly improper. Article 5 No law enforcement official may inflict, instigate or tolerate  any act of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment  or punishment, nor may any law enforcement official invoke superior  orders or exceptional circumstances such as a state of war or  a threat of war, a threat to national security, internal political  instability or any other public emergency as a justification  of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or  punishment . Commentary: (a) This prohibition derives from the Declaration on the Protection  of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel,  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted by the  General Assembly, according to which: ""[Such an act is]  an offence to human dignity and shall be condemned as a denial  of the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and as a  violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed  in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [and other international  human rights instruments]."" (b) The Declaration defines torture as follows: "". . . torture means any act by which severe pain or  suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted  by or at the instigation of a public official on a person for  such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information  or confession, punishing him for an act he has committed or is  suspected of having committed, or intimidating him or other persons.  It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent  in or incidental to, lawful sanctions to the extent consistent  with the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners."" (c) The term ""cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or  punishment"" has not been defined by the General Assembly  but should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible  protection against abuses, whether physical or mental. Article 6 Law enforcement officials shall ensure the full protection  of the health of persons in their custody and, in particular,  shall take immediate action to secure medical attention whenever  required. Commentary: (a) ""Medical attention"", which refers to services  rendered by any medical personnel, including certified medical  practitioners and paramedics, shall be secured when needed or  requested. (b) While the medical personnel are likely to be attached  to the law enforcement operation, law enforcement officials must  take into account the judgement of such personnel when they recommend  providing the person in custody with appropriate treatment through,  or in consultation with, medical personnel from outside the law  enforcement operation. (c) It is understood that law enforcement officials shall  also secure medical attention for victims of violations of law  or of accidents occurring in the course of violations of law. Article 7 Law enforcement officials shall not commit any act of corruption.  They shall also rigorously oppose and combat all such acts. Commentary: (a) Any act of corruption, in the same way as any other abuse  of authority, is incompatible with the profession of law enforcement  officials. The law must be enforced fully with respect to any  law enforcement official who commits an act of corruption, as  Governments cannot expect to enforce the law among their citizens  if they cannot, or will not, enforce the law against their own  agents and within their agencies. (b) While the definition of corruption must be subject to  national law, it should be understood to encompass the commission  or omission of an act in the performance of or in connection  with one's duties, in response to gifts, promises or incentives  demanded or accepted, or the wrongful receipt of these once the  act has been committed or omitted. (c) The expression ""act of corruption"" referred  to above should be understood to encompass attempted corruption. Article 8 Law enforcement officials shall respect the law and the present  Code. They shall also, to the best of their capability, prevent  and rigorously oppose any violations of them. Law enforcement officials who have reason to believe that  a violation of the present Code has occurred or is about to occur  shall report the matter to their superior authorities and, where  necessary, to other appropriate authorities or organs vested  with reviewing or remedial power. Commentary: (a) This Code shall be observed whenever it has been incorporated  into national legislation or practice. If legislation or practice  contains stricter provisions than those of the present Code,  those stricter provisions shall be observed. (b) The article seeks to preserve the balance between the  need for internal discipline of the agency on which public safety  is largely dependent, on the one hand, and the need for dealing  with violations of basic human rights, on the other. Law enforcement  officials shall report violations within the chain of command  and take other lawful action outside the chain of command only  when no other remedies are available or effective. It is understood  that law enforcement officials shall not suffer administrative  or other penalties because they have reported that a violation  of this Code has occurred or is about to occur. (c) The term ""appropriate authorities or organs vested  with reviewing or remedial power"" refers to any authority  or organ existing under national law, whether internal to the  law enforcement agency or independent thereof, with statutory,  customary or other power to review grievances and complaints  arising out of violations within the purview of this Code. (d) In some countries, the mass media may be regarded as performing  complaint review functions similar to those described in subparagraph  (c) above. Law enforcement officials may, therefore, be justified  if, as a last resort and in accordance with the laws and customs  of their own countries and with the provisions of article 4 of  the present Code, they bring violations to the attention of public  opinion through the mass media. (e) Law enforcement officials who comply with the provisions  of this Code deserve the respect, the full support and the co-operation  of the community and of the law enforcement agency in which they  serve, as well as the law enforcement profession.

" Political Rights, Freedom of Information, and Right to Culture ",http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/u1circ.htm," Convention on the International Right of Correction, 435 U.N.T.S. 191, entered into force Aug. 24, 1962.  PREAMBLE The Contracting States, Desiring to implement the right of their peoples to be fully and reliably informed, Desiring to improve understanding between their peoples through the free flow of information and opinion, Desiring thereby to protect mankind from the scourge of war, to prevent the recurrence of aggression from any source, and to combat all propaganda which is either designed or likely to provoke or encourage any threat to peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, Considering the danger to the maintenance of friendly relations between peoples and to the preservation of peace, arising from the publication of inaccurate reports, Considering that at its second regular session the General Assembly of the United Nations recommended the adoption of measures designed to combat the dissemination of false or distorted reports likely to injure friendly relations between States, Considering, however, that it is not at present practicable to institute, on the international level, a procedure for verifying the accuracy of a report which might lead to the imposition of penalties for the publication of false or distorted reports, Considering, .moreover, that to prevent the publication of reports of this nature or to reduce their pernicious effects, it is above all necessary to promote a wide circulation of news and to heighten the sense of responsibility of those regularly engaged in the dissemination of news, Considering that an effective means to these ends is to give States directly affected by a report, which they consider false or distorted and which is disseminated by an information agency, the possibility of securing commensurate publicity for their corrections, Considering that the legislation of certain States does not provide for a right of correction of which foreign governments may avail themselves, and that it is therefore desirable to institute such a right on the international level, and Having resolved to conclude a Convention for these purposes, Have agreed as follows: Article 1 For the purposes of the present Convention: 1. ""News dispatch"" means news material transmitted in writing or by means of telecommunications, in the form customarily employed by information agencies in transmitting such news material, before publication, to newspapers, news periodicals and broadcasting organizations. 2. ""Information agency"" means a press, broadcasting, film, television or facsimile organization, public or private, regularly engaged in the collection, and dissemination of news material, created and organized under the laws and regulations of the Contracting State in which the central organization is domiciled and which, in each Contracting State where it operates, functions under the laws and regulations of that State. 3. ""Correspondent"" means a national of a Contracting State or an individual employed by an information agency of a Contracting State, who in either case is regularly engaged in the collection and the reporting of news material, and who when outside his State is identified as a correspondent by a valid passport or by a similar document internationally acceptable. Article 2 1. Recognizing that the professional responsibility of correspondents and information agencies requires them to report facts without discrimination and in their proper context and thereby to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, to further international understanding and co-operation and to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, Considering also that, as a matter of professional ethics, all correspondents and information agencies should, in the case of news dispatches transmitted or published by them and which have been demonstrated to be false or distorted, follow the customary practice of transmitting through the same channels, or of publishing corrections of such dispatches, The Contracting States agree that in cases where a Contracting State contends that a news dispatch capable of injuring its relations with other States or its national prestige or dignity transmitted from one country to another by correspondents or information agencies of a Contracting or non-Contracting State and published or disseminated abroad is false or distorted, it may submit its version of the facts (hereinafter called ""communique"") to the Contracting States within whose territories such dispatch has been published or disseminated. A copy of the communique shall be forwarded at the same time to the correspondent or information agency concerned to enable that correspondent or information agency to correct the news dispatch in question. 2. A communique may be issued only with respect to news dispatches and must be without comment or expression of opinion. It should not be longer than is necessary to correct the alleged inaccuracy or distortion and must be accompanied by a verbatim text of the dispatch as published or disseminated, and by evidence that the dispatch has been transmitted from abroad by a correspondent or an information agency. Article 3 1. With the least possible delay and in any case not later than five clear days from the date of receiving a communique transmitted in accordance with provisions of article II, a Contracting State, whatever be its opinion concerning the facts in question, shall: (a) Release the communique to the correspondents and information agencies operating in its territory through the channels customarily used for the release of news concerning international affairs for publications; and (b) Transmit the communique to the headquarters of the information agency whose correspondent was responsible for originating the dispatch in question, if such headquarters are within its territory. 2. In the event that a Contracting State does not discharge its obligation under this article, with respect to the communique of another Contracting State, the latter may accord, on the basis of reciprocity, similar treatment to a communique thereafter submitted to it by the defaulting State. Article 4 1. If any of the Contracting States to which a communique has been transmitted in accordance with article II fails to fulfil, within the prescribed time-limit, the obligations laid down in article III, the Contracting State exercising the right of correction may submit the said communique, together with a verbatim text of the dispatch as published or disseminated, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and shall at the same time notify the State complained against that it is doing so. The latter State, may, within five clear days after receiving such notice, submit its comments to the Secretary-General, which shall relate only to the allegation that it has not discharged its obligations under article III. 2. The Secretary-General shall in any event, within ten clear days after receiving the communique, give appropriate publicity through the information channels at his disposal to the communique, together with the dispatch and the comments, if any, submitted to him by the State complained against.

Article 9 The provisions of the present Convention shall extend to or be applicable equally to a contracting metropolitan State and all territories, be they Non-Self-Governing, Trust or Colonial Territories, which are being administered or governed by such metropolitan State. Article 10 Any Contracting State may denounce the present Convention by notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Denunciation shall take effect six months after the date of receipt of the notification by the Secretary-General. Article 11 The present Convention shall cease to be in force as from the date when the denunciation which reduces the number of Parties to less than six becomes effective. Article 12 1. A request for the revision of the present Convention may be made at any time by any Contracting State by means of a notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 2.

The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, and having met in its fourteenth session on 10 June 1930, and Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to forced or compulsory labour, which is included in the first item on the agenda of the session, and Having determined that these proposals shall take the form of an international Convention, Adopts this twenty-eighth day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty the following Convention, which may be cited as the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, for ratification by the Members of the International Labour Organisation in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation: Article I 1. Each Member of the International Labour Organisation which ratifies this Convention undertakes to suppress the use of forced or compulsory labour in all its forms within the shortest possible period. 2. With a view to this complete suppression, recourse to forced or compulsory labour may be had, during the transitional period, for public purposes only and as an exceptional measure, subject to the conditions and guarantees hereinafter provided. 3. At the expiration of a period of five years after the coming into force of this Convention, and when the Governing Body of the International Labour Office prepares the report provided for in article 31 below, the said  Governing Body shall consider the possibility of the suppression of forced or compulsory labour in all its forms without a further transitional period and the desirability of placing this question on the agenda of the Conference. Article 2 1. For the purposes of this Convention the term ""forced or compulsory labour"" shall mean all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily. 2. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this Convention the term ""forced or compulsory labour"" shall not include: (a) Any work or service exacted in virtue of compulsory military service laws for work of a purely military character; (b) Any work or service which forms part of the normal civic obligations of the citizens of a fully self-governing country; (c) Any work or service exacted from any person as a consequence of a conviction in a court of law, provided that the said work or service is carried out under the supervision and control of a public authority and that the said person is not hired to or placed at the disposal of private individuals, companies or associations; (d) Any work or service exacted in cases of emergency, that is to say, in the event of war or of a calamity or threatened calamity, such as fire, flood, famine, earthquake, violent epidemic or epizootic diseases, invasion by animal, insect or vegetable pests, and in general any circumstance that would endanger the existence or the well-being of the whole or part of the population; (e) Minor communal services of a kind which, being performed by the members of the community in the direct interest of the said community, can therefore be considered as normal civic obligations incumbent upon the members of the community, provided that the members of the community or their direct representatives shall have the right to be consulted in regard to the need for such services. Article 3 For the purposes of this Convention the term ""competent authority"" shall mean either an authority of the metropolitan country or the highest central authority in the territory concerned. Article 4 1. The competent authority shall not impose or permit the imposition of forced or compulsory labour for the benefit of private individuals, companies or associations. 2. Where such forced or compulsory labour for the benefit of private individuals, companies or associations exists at the date on which a Member's ratification of this Convention is registered by the Director-General of the International Labour Office, the Member shall completely suppress such forced or compulsory labour from the date on which this Convention comes into force for that Member. Article 5 1. No concession granted to private individuals, companies or associations shall involve any form of forced or compulsory labour for the production or the collection of products which such private individuals, companies or associations utilise or in which they trade. 2.

Article 6 Officials of the administration, even when they have the duty of encouraging the populations under their charge to engage in some form of labour, shall not put constraint upon the said populations or upon any individual members thereof to work for private individuals, companies or associations. Article 7 1. Chiefs who do not exercise administrative functions shall not have recourse to forced or compulsory labour. 2. Chiefs who exercise administrative functions may, with the express permission of the competent authority, have recourse to forced or compulsory labour, subject to the provisions of article 10 of this Convention. 3. Chiefs who are duly recognised and who do not receive adequate remuneration in other forms may have the enjoyment of personal services, subject to due regulation and provided that all necessary measures are taken to prevent abuses. Article 8 1. The responsibility for every decision to have recourse to forced or compulsory labour shall rest with the highest civil authority in the territory concerned. 2. Nevertheless, that authority may delegate powers to the highest local authorities to exact forced or compulsory labour which does not involve the removal of the workers from their place of habitual residence. That authority may also delegate, for such periods and subject to such conditions as may be laid down in the regulations provided for in article 23 of this Convention, powers to the highest local authorities to exact forced or compulsory labour which involves the removal of the workers from their place of habitual residence for the purpose of facilitating the movement of officials of the administration, when on duty, and for the transport of Government stores. Article 9 Except as otherwise provided for in article 10 of this Convention, any authority competent to exact forced or compulsory labour shall, before deciding to have recourse to such labour, satisfy itself: (a) That the work to be done or the service to be rendered is of important direct interest for the community called upon to do the work or render the service; (b) That the work or service is of present or imminent necessity; (c) That it has been impossible to obtain voluntary labour for carrying out the work or rendering the service by the offer of rates of wages and conditions of labour not less favourable than those prevailing in the area concerned for similar work or service; and (d) That the work or service will not lay too heavy a burden upon the present population, having regard to the labour available and its capacity to undertake the work. Article 10 1. Forced or compulsory labour exacted as a tax and forced or compulsory labour to which recourse is had for the execution of public works by chiefs who exercise administrative functions shall be progressively abolished. 2. Meanwhile, where forced or compulsory labour is exacted as a tax, and where recourse is had to forced or compulsory labour for the execution of public works by chiefs who exercise administrative functions, the authority concerned shall first satisfy itself: (a) That the work to be done or the service to be rendered is of important direct interest for the community called upon to do the work or render the service; (b) That the work or the service is of present or imminent necessity; (c) That the work or service will not lay too heavy a burden upon the present population, having regard to the labour available and its capacity to undertake the work; (d ) That the work or service will not entail the removal of the workers from their place of habitual residence; (e) That the execution of the work or the rendering of the service will be directed in accordance with the exigencies of religion, social life and agriculture. Article 11 1. Only adult able-bodied males who are of an apparent age of not less than 18 and not more than 45 years may be called upon for forced or compulsory labour. Except in respect of the kinds of labour provided for in article 10 of this Convention, the following limitations and conditions shall apply: (a) Whenever possible prior determination by a medical officer appointed by the administration that the persons concerned are not suffering from any infectious or contagious disease and that they are physically fit for the work required and for the conditions under which it is to be carried out; (b) Exemption of school teachers and pupils and of officials of the administration in general; (c) The maintenance in each community of the number of adult ablebodied men indispensable for family and social life; (d ) Respect for conjugal and family ties. 2. For the purposes of subparagraph (c) of the preceding paragraph, the regulations provided for in article 23 of this Convention shall fix the proportion of the resident adult able-bodied males who may be taken at any one time for forced or compulsory labour, provided always that this proportion shall in no case exceed 25 per cent. In fixing this proportion the competent authority shall take account of the density of the population, of its social and physical development, of the seasons, and of the work which must be done by the persons concerned on their own behalf in their locality, and, generally, shall have regard to the economic and social necessities of the normal life of the community concerned. Article 12 1. The maximum period for which any person may be taken for forced or compulsory labour of all kinds in any one period of twelve months shall not exceed sixty days, including the time spent in going to and from the place of work. 2. Every person from whom forced or compulsory labour is exacted shall be furnished with a certificate indicating the periods of such labour which he has completed. Article 13 1. The normal working hours of any person from whom forced or compulsory labour is exacted shall be the same as those prevailing in the case of voluntary labour, and the hours worked in excess of the normal working hours shall be remunerated at the rates prevailing in the case of overtime for voluntary labour. 2. A weekly day of rest shall be granted to all persons from whom forced or compulsory labour of any kind is exacted and this day shall coincide as far as possible with the day fixed by tradition or custom in the territories or regions concerned. Article 14 1. With the exception of the forced or compulsory labour provided for in article 10 of this Convention, forced or compulsory labour of all kinds shall be remunerated in cash at rates not less than those prevailing for similar kinds of work either in the district in which the labour is employed or in the district from which the labour is recruited, whichever may be the higher. 2. In the case of labour to which recourse is had by chiefs in the exercise of their administrative functions, payment of wages in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall be introduced as soon as possible. 3. The wages shall be paid to each worker individually and not to his tribal chief or to any other authority. 4. For the purpose of payment of wages the days spent in travelling to and from the place of work shall be counted as working days. 5. Nothing in this article shall prevent ordinary rations being given as a part of wages, such rations to be at least equivalent in value to the money payment they are taken to represent, but deductions from wages shall not be made either for the payment of taxes or for special food, clothing or accommodation supplied to a worker for the purpose of maintaining him in a fit condition to carry on his work under the special conditions of any employment, or for the supply of tools. Article 15 1. Any laws or regulations relating to workmen's compensation for accidents or sickness arising out of the employment of the worker and any laws or regulations providing compensation for the dependants of deceased or incapacitated workers which are or shall be in force in the territory concerned shall be equally applicable to persons from whom forced or compulsory labour is exacted and to voluntary workers. 2. In any case it shall be an obligation on any authority employing any worker on forced or compulsory labour to ensure the subsistence of any such worker who, by accident or sickness arising out of his employment, is rendered wholly or partially incapable of providing for himself, and to take measures to ensure the maintenance of any persons actually dependent upon such a worker in the event of his incapacity or decease arising out of his employment. Article 16 1. Except in cases of special necessity, persons from whom forced or compulsory labour is exacted shall not be transferred to districts where the food and climate differ so considerably from those to which they have been accustomed as to endanger their health. 2. In no case shall the transfer of such workers be permitted unless all measures relating to hygiene and accommodation which are necessary to adapt such workers to the conditions and to safeguard their health can be strictly applied. 3. When such transfer cannot be avoided, measures of gradual habituation to the new conditions of diet and of climate shall be adopted on competent medical advice. 4. In cases where such workers are required to perform regular work to which they are not accustomed, measures shall be taken to ensure their habituation to it, especially as regards progressive training, the hours of work and the provision of rest intervals, and any increase or amelioration of diet which may be necessary. Article 17 Before permitting recourse to forced or compulsory labour for works of construction or maintenance which entail the workers remaining at the work-places for considerable periods, the competent authority shall satisfy itself: (I) That all necessary measures are taken to safeguard the health of the workers and to guarantee the necessary medical care, and, in particular, (a) that the workers are medically examined before commencing the work and at fixed intervals during the period of service, (b) that there is an adequate medical staff, provided with the dispensaries, infirmaries, hospitals and equipment necessary to meet all requirements, and (c) that the sanitary conditions of the work-places, the supply of drinking water, food, fuel, and cooking ustensils, and, where necessary;-of housing and clothing are satisfactory; (2) That definite arrangements are made to ensure the subsistence of the families of the workers, in particular by facilitating the remittance, by a safe method, of part of the wages to the family, at the request or with the consent of the workers; (3) That the journey of the workers to and from the workplaces are made at the expense and under the responsibility of the administration, which shall facilitate such journeys by making the fullest use of all available means of transport; (4) That, in case of illness or accident causing incapacity to work of a certain duration, the worker is repatriated at the expense of the administration; (5) That any worker who may wish to remain as a voluntary worker at the end of his period of forced or compulsory labour is permitted to do so without, for a period of two years, losing his right to repatriation free of expense to himself. Article 18 1. Forced or compulsory labour for the transport of persons or goods, such as the labour of porters or boatmen, shall be abolished within the shortest possible period. Meanwhile the competent authority shall promulgate regulations determining, inter alia, (a) that such labour shall only be employed for the purpose of facilitating the movement of officials of the administration, when on duty, or for the transport of Government stores, or, in cases of very urgent necessity, the transport of persons other than officials, (b) that the workers so employed shall be medically certified to be physically fit, where medical examination is possible, and that where such medical examination is not practicable the person employing such workers shall be held responsible for ensuring that they are physically fit and not suffering from any infectious or contagious diseases, (c) the maximum load which these workers may carry, (d) the maximum distance from their homes to which they may be taken, (e) the maximum number of days per month or other period for which they may be taken, including the days spent in returning to their homes, and (1) the persons entitled to demand this form of forced or compulsory labour and the extent to which they are entitled to demand it. 2. In fixing the maxima referred to under (c), (d ) and (e) in the foregoing paragraph, the competent authority shall have regard to all relevant factors, including the physical development of the population from which the workers are recruited, the nature of the country through which they must travel and the climatic conditions. 3. The competent authority shall further provide that the normal daily journey of such workers shall not exceed a distance corresponding to an average working day of eight hours, it being understood that account shall be taken not only of the weight to be carried and the distance to be covered, but also of the nature of the road, the season and all other relevant factors, and that, where hours of journey in excess of the normal daily journey are exacted, they shall be remunerated at rates higher than the normal rates. Article 19 1. The competent authority shall only authorise recourse to compulsory cultivation as a method of precaution against famine or a deficiency of food supplies and always under the condition that the food or produce shall remain the property of the individuals or the community producing it. 2. Nothing in this article shall be construed as abrogating the obligation on members of a community, where production is organised on a communal basis by virtue of law or custom and where the procedure or any profit accruing from the sale thereof remain the property of the community, to perform the work demanded by the community by virtue of law or custom. Article 20 Collective punishment laws under which a community may be punished for crimes committed by any of its members shall not contain provisions for forced or compulsory labour by the community as one of the methods of punishment. Article 21 Forced or compulsory labour shall not be used for work underground in mines. Article 22 The annual reports that Members which ratify this Convention agree to make to the International Labour Office, pursuant to the provisions of article 22 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, on the measures they have taken to give effect to the provisions of this Convention, shall contain as full information as possible, in respect of each territory concerned, regarding the extent to which recourse has been had to forced or compulsory labour in that territory, the purposes for which it has been employed, the sickness and death rates, hours of work, methods of payment of wages and rates of wages, and any other relevant information. Article 23 1. To give effect to the provisions of this Convention the competent authority shall issue complete and precise regulations governing the use of forced or compulsory labour. 2. These regulations shall contain, inter alia, rules permitting any person from whom forced or compulsory labour is exacted to forward all complaints relative to the conditions of labour to the authorities and ensuring that such complaints will be examined and taken into consideration. Article 24 Adequate measures shall in all cases be taken to ensure that the regulations governing the employment of forced or compulsory labour are strictly applied, either by extending the duties of any existing labour inspectorate which has been established for the inspection of voluntary labour to cover the inspection of forced or compulsory labour or in some other appropriate manner. Measures shall also be taken to ensure that the regulations are brought to the knowledge of persons from whom such labour is exacted. Article 25 The illegal exaction of forced or compulsory labour shall be punishable as a penal offence, and it shall be an obligation on any Member ratifying this Convention to ensure that the penalties imposed by law are really adequate and are strictly enforced. Article 26 1. Each Member of the International Labour (Organisation which ratifies this Convention undertakes to apply it to the territories placed under its sovereignty, jurisdiction, protection, suzerainty, tutelage or authority, so far as it has the right to accept obligations affecting matters of internal jurisdiction; provided that, if such Member may desire to take advantage of the provisions of article 35 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, it shall append to its ratification a declaration stating: (1) The territories to which it intends to apply the provisions of this Convention without modification; (2) The territories to which it intends to apply the provisions of this Convention with modifications, together with details of the said modifications; (3) The territories in respect of which it reserves its decision. 2. The aforesaid declaration shall be deemed to be an integral pan of the ratification and shall have the force of ratification.

GAOR, 34th Sess., Supp. No. 46, at 245, U.N. Doc. A/34/46 (1979), entered into force June 3, 1983.  THE STATES PARTIES to this Convention, HAVING IN MIND the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations concerning the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of friendly relations and co-operation among States, RECOGNIZING in particular that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, REAFFIRMING the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, as well as in other relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, CONSIDERING that the taking of hostages is an offence of grave concern to the international community and that, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, any person committing an act of hostage taking shall either be prosecuted or extradited, BEING CONVINCED that it is urgently necessary to develop international co-operation between States in devising and adopting effective measures for the prevention, prosecution and punishment of all acts of taking of hostages as manifestations of international terrorism, HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS: ARTICLE 1 Any person who seizes or detains and threatens to kill, to injure or to continue to detain another person (hereinafter referred to as the ""hostage"") in order to compel a third party, namely, a State, an international intergovernmental organization, a natural or juridical person, or a group of persons, to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the hostage commits the offence of taking of hostages (""hostage-taking"") within the meaning of this Convention. Any person who: attempts to commit an act of hostage-taking, or participates as an accomplice of anyone who commits or attempts to commit an act of hostage-taking likewise commits an offence for the purposes of this Convention. ARTICLE 2 Each State Party shall make the offences set forth in article 1 punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account the grave nature of those offences. ARTICLE 3 The State Party in the territory of which the hostage is held by the offender shall take all measures it considers appropriate to ease the situation of the hostage, in particular, to secure his release and, after his release, to facilitate, when relevant, his departure. If any object which the offender has obtained as a result of the taking of hostages comes into the custody of a State Party, that State Party shall return it as soon as possible to the hostage or the third party referred to in article 1, as the case may be, or to the appropriate authorities thereof. ARTICLE 4 States Parties shall co-operate in the prevention of the offences set forth in article 1, particularly by: taking all practicable measures to prevent preparations in their respective territories for the commission of those offences within or outside their territories, including measures to prohibit in their territories illegal activities of persons, groups and organizations that encourage, instigate, organize or engage in the perpetration of acts of taking of hostages; exchanging information and co-ordinating the taking of administrative and other measures as appropriate to prevent the commission of those offences. ARTICLE 5 Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over any of the offences set forth in article 1 which are committed: in its territory or on board a ship or aircraft registered in that State; by any of its nationals or, if that State considers it appropriate, by those stateless persons who have their habitual residence in its territory; in order to compel that State to do or abstain from doing any act; or with respect to a hostage who is a national of that State, if that State considers it appropriate. Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offences set forth in article 1 in cases where the alleged offender is present in its territory and it does not extradite him to any of the States mentioned in paragraph 1 of this article. This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with internal law. ARTICLE 6 Upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, any State Party in the territory of which the alleged offender is present shall, in accordance with its laws, take him into custody or take other measures to ensure his presence for such time as is necessary to enable any criminal or extradition proceedings to be instituted. That State Party shall immediately make a preliminary inquiry into the facts. The custody or other measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall be notified without delay directly or through the Secretary-General of the United Nations to: the State where the offence was committed; the State against which compulsion has been directed or attempted; the State of which the natural or juridical person against whom compulsion has been directed or attempted is a national; the State of which the hostage is a national or in the territory of which he has his habitual residence; the State of which the alleged offender is a national or, if he is a stateless person, in the territory of which he has his habitual residence; the international intergovernmental organization against which compulsion has been directed or attempted; all other States concerned. Any person regarding whom the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this article are being taken shall be entitled: to communicate without delay with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which he is a national or which is otherwise entitled to establish such communication or, if he is a stateless person, the State in the territory of which he has his habitual residence; to be visited by a representative of that State. The rights referred to in paragraph 3 of this article shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the State in the territory of which the alleged offender is present subject to the proviso, however, that the said laws and regulations must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under paragraph 3 of this article are intended. The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article shall be without prejudice to the right of any State Party having a claim to jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 1(b) of article 5 to invite the International Committee of the Red Cross to communicate with and visit the alleged offender. The State which makes the preliminary inquiry contemplated in paragraph 1 of this article shall promptly report its findings to the States or organization referred to in paragraph 2 of this article and indicate whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction. ARTICLE 7 The State Party where the alleged offender is prosecuted shall in accordance with its laws communicate the final outcome of the proceedings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who shall transmit the information to the other States concerned and the international intergovernmental organizations concerned. ARTICLE 8 The State Party in the territory of which the alleged offender is found shall, if it does not extradite him, be obliged, without exception whatsoever and whether or not the offence was committed in its territory, to submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution, through proceedings in accordance with the laws of that State. Those authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of a grave nature under the law of that State. Any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connexion with any of the offences set forth in article 1 shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings, including enjoyment of all the rights and guarantees provided by the law of the State in the territory of which he is present. ARTICLE 9 A request for the extradition of an alleged offender, pursuant to this Convention, shall not be granted if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing: that the request for extradition for an offence set forth in article 1 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion; or that the person's position may be prejudiced: for any of the reasons mentioned in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, or for the reason that communication with him by the appropriate authorities of the State entitled to exercise rights of protection cannot be effected. With respect to the offences as defined in this Convention, the provisions of all extradition treaties and arrangements applicable between States Parties are modified as between States Parties to the extent that they are incompatible with this Convention. ARTICLE 10 The offences set forth in article 1 shall be deemed to be included as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties. States Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be concluded between them. If a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, the requested State may at its option consider this Convention as the legal basis for extradition in respect of the offences set forth in article 1. Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of the requested State. States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the offences set forth in article 1 as extraditable offences between themselves subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested State. The offences set forth in article I shall be treated, for the purpose of extradition between States Parties, as if they had been committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the territories of the States required to establish their jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 1 of article 5. ARTICLE 11 States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connexion with criminal proceedings brought in respect of the offences set forth in article 1, including the supply of all evidence at their disposal necessary for the proceedings. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall not affect obligations concerning mutual judicial assistance embodied in any other treaty. ARTICLE 12 In so far as the Geneva Conventions of 1949 for the protection of war victims or the Additional Protocols to those Conventions are applicable to a particular act of hostage-taking, and in so far as States Parties to this Convention are bound under those conventions to prosecute or hand over the hostage-taker, the present Convention shall not apply to an act of hostage-taking committed in the course of armed conflicts as defined in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Protocols thereto, including armed conflicts mentioned in article 1, paragraph 4, of Additional Protocol I of 1977, in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self- determination, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. ARTICLE 13 This Convention shall not apply where the offence is committed within a single State, the hostage and the alleged offender are nationals of that State and the alleged offender is found in the territory of that State. ARTICLE 14 Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as justifying the violation of the territorial integrity or political independence of a State in contravention of the Charter of the United Nations. ARTICLE 15 The provisions of this Convention shall not affect the application of the Treaties on Asylum, in force at the date of the adoption of this Convention, as between the States which are parties to those Treaties; but a State Party to this convention may not invoke those Treaties with respect to another State Party to this Convention which is not a party to those treaties. ARTICLE 16 Any dispute between two or more States Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Convention which is not settled by negotiation shall, at the request of one of them, be submitted to arbitration. If within six months from the date of the request for arbitration the parties are unable to agree on the organization of the arbitration, any one of those parties may refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice by request in conformity with the Statute of the Court. Each State may at the time of signature or ratification of this Convention or accession thereto declare that it does not consider itself bound by paragraph 1 of this article. The other States Parties shall not be bound by paragraph 1 of this article with respect to any State Party which has made such a reservation. Any State Party which has made a reservation in accordance with paragraph 2 of this article may at any time withdraw that reservation by notification to the Secretary-General in the United Nations. ARTICLE 17 This Convention is open for signature by all States until 31 December 1980 at United Nations Headquarters in New York. This Convention is subject to ratification. The instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. This Convention is open for accession by any State. The instruments of accession shall be deposited with the Secretary- General of the United Nations. ARTICLE 18 This Convention shall enter into force on the thirtieth day following the date of deposit of the twenty-second instrument of ratification or accession with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. For each State ratifying or acceding to the Convention after the deposit of the twenty-second instrument of ratification or accession, the Convention shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after deposit by such State of its instrument of ratification or accession. ARTICLE 19 Any State Party may denounce this Convention by written notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Denunciation shall take effect one year following the date on which notification is received by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. ARTICLE 20 The original of this Convention, of which the Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish texts are equally authentic, shall be deposited with the Secretary General of the United Nations, who shall send certified copies thereof to all States. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, being duly authorized thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Convention, opened for signature at New York on 18 December 1979.

Article 6 Exercise of Consular Functions Outside the Consular District A consular officer may, in special circumstances, with the consent of the receiving State, exercise his functions outside his consular district. Article 7 Exercise of Consular Functions in a Third State The sending State may, after notifying the States concerned, entrust a consular post established in a particular State with the exercise of consular functions in another State, unless there is express objection by one of the States concerned. Article 8 Exercise of Consular Functions on Behalf of a Third State Upon appropriate notification to the receiving State, a consular post of the sending State may, unless the receiving State objects, exercise consular functions in the receiving State on behalf of a third State. Article 9 Classes of Heads of Consular Posts  Heads of consular posts are divided into four classes, namely: consuls-general; consuls;  vice-consuls; (consular agents. Paragraph 1 of this Article in no way restricts the right of any of the Contracting Parties to fix the designation of consular officers other than the heads of consular posts. Article 10 Appointment and Admission of Heads of Consular Posts  Heads of consular posts are appointed by the sending State and are admitted to the exercise of their functions by the receiving State. Subject to the provisions of the present Convention, the formalities for the appointment and for the admission of the head of a consular post are determined by the laws, regulations and usages of the sending State and of the receiving State respectively. Article 11 The Consular Commission or Notification of Appointment The head of a consular post shall be provided by the sending State with a document, in the form of a commission or similar instrument, made out for each appointment, certifying his capacity and showing, as a general rule, his full name, his category and class, the consular district and the seat of the consular post.  The sending State shall transmit the commission or similar instrument through the diplomatic or other appropriate channel to the Government of the State in whose territory the head of a consular post is to exercise his functions. 3. If the receiving State agrees, the sending State may, instead of a commission or similar instrument, send to the receiving State a notification containing the particulars required by paragraph 1 of this Article. Article 12 The Exequatur The head of a consular post is admitted to the exercise of his functions by an authorization from the receiving State termed an exequatur, whatever the form of this authorization. A State which refuses to grant an exequatur is not obliged to give to the sending State reasons for such refusal. Subject to the provisions of Articles 13 and 15, the head of a consular post shall not enter upon his duties until he has received an exequatur. Article 13 Provisional Admission of Heads of Consular Posts Pending delivery of the exequatur, the head of a consular post may be admitted on a provisional basis to the exercise of his functions. In that case, the provisions of the present Convention shall apply. Article 14 Notification to the Austhorities of the Consular District As soon as the head of a consular post is admitted even provisionally to the exercise of his functions, the receiving State shall immediately notify the competent authorities of the consular district. It shall also ensure that the necessary measures are taken to enable the head of a consular post to carry out the duties of his office and to have the benefit of the provisions of the present Convention. Article 15 Temporary Exercise of the Functions of the Head of a Consular Post If the head of a consular post is unable to carry out his functions or the position of head of consular post is vacant, an acting head of post may act provisionally as head of the consular post.\  The full name of the acting head of post shall be notified either by the diplomatic mission of the sending State or, if that State has no such mission in the receiving State, by the head of the consular post, or, if he is unable to do so, by any competent authority of the sending State, to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the receiving State or to the authority designated by that Ministry. As a general rule, this notification shall be given in advance. The receiving State may make the admission as acting head of post of a person who is neither a diplomatic agent nor a consular officer of the sending State in the receiving State conditional on its consent. The competent authorities of the receiving State shall afford assistance and protection to the acting head of post. While he is in charge of the post, the provisions of the present Convention shall apply to him on the same basis as to the head of the consular post concerned. The receiving State shall not, however, be obliged to grant to an acting head of post any facility, privilege or immunity which the head of the consular post enjoys only subject to conditions not fulfilled by the acting head of post. When, in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, a member of the diplomatic staff of the diplomatic mission of the sending State in the receiving State is designated by the sending State as an acting head of post, he shall, if the receiving State does not object thereto, continue to enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities. Article 16 Precedence as Between Heads of Consular Posts Heads of consular posts shall rank in each class according to the date of the grant of the exequatur. If, however, the head of a consular post before obtaining the exequatur is admitted to the exercise of his functions provisionally, his precedence shall be determined according to the date of the provisional admission; this precedence shall be maintained after the granting of the exequatur. The order of precedence as between two or more heads of consular posts who obtained the exequatur or provisional admission on the same date shall be determined according to the dates on which their commissions or similar instruments or the notifications referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 11 were presented to the receiving State. Acting heads of posts shall rank after all heads of consular posts and, as between themselves, they shall rank according to the dates on which they assumed their functions as acting heads of posts as indicated in the notifications given under paragraph 2 of Article 15. Honorary consular officers who are heads of consular posts shall rank in each class after career heads of consular posts, in the order and according to the rules laid down in the foregoing paragraphs. Heads of consular posts shall have precedence over consular officers not having that status. Article 17 Performance of Diplomatic Acts by Consular Officers  In a State where the sending State has no diplomatic mission and is not represented by a diplomatic mission of a third State, a consular officer may, with the consent of the receiving State, and without affecting his consular status, be authorized to perform diplomatic acts. The performance of such acts by a consular officer shall not confer upon him any right to claim diplomatic privileges and immunities. A consular officer may, after notification addressed to the receiving State, act as representative of the sending State to any inter-governmental organization. When so acting, he shall be entitled to enjoy any privileges and immunities accorded to such a representative by customary international law or by international agreements; however, in respect of the performance by him of any consular function, he shall not be entitled to any greater immunity from jurisdiction than that to which a consular officer is entitled under the present Convention. Article 18 Appointment of the Same Person by Two or More States as a Consular Officer Two or more States may, with the consent of the receiving State, appoint the same person as a consular officer in that State. Article 19 Appointment of Members of Consular Staff  Subject to the provisions of Articles 20, 22 and 23, the sending State may freely appoint the members of the consular staff. The full name, category and class of all consular officers, other than the head of a consular post, shall be notified by the sending State to the receiving State in sufficient time for the receiving State, if it so wishes, to exercise its rights under paragraph 3 of Article 23. The sending State may, if required by its laws and regulations, request the receiving State to grant an exequatur to a consular officer other than the head of a consular post. The receiving State may, if required by its laws and regulations, grant an exequatur to a consular officer other than the head of a consular post. Article 20 Size of the Consular Staff In the absence of an express agreement as to the size of the consular staff, the receiving State may require that the size of the staff be kept within limits considered by it to be reasonable and normal, having regard to circumstances and conditions in the consular district and to the needs of the particular post. Article 21 Pprecedence as Between Consular Officers of a Consular Post The order of precedence as between the consular officers of a consular post and any change thereof shall be notified by the diplomatic mission of the sending State or, if that State has no such mission in the receiving State, by the head of the consular post, to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the receiving State or to the authority designated by that Ministry. Article 22 Nationality of Consular Officers Consular officers should, in principle, have the nationality of the sending State. Consular officers may not be appointed from among persons having the nationality of the receiving State except with the express consent of that State which may be withdrawn at any time. The receiving State may reserve the same right with regard to nationals of a third State who are not also nationals of the sending State. Article 23 Persons Declared ""Non Grata"" The receiving State may at any time notify the sending State that a consular officer is persona non grata or that any other member of the consular staff is not acceptable. In that event, the sending State shall, as the case may be, either recall the person concerned or terminate his functions with the consular post. If the sending State refuses or fails within a reasonable time to carry out its obligations under paragraph 1 of this Article, the receiving State may, as the case may be, either withdraw the exequatur from the person concerned or cease to consider him as a member of the consular staff. A person appointed as a member of a consular post may be declared unacceptable before arriving in the territory of the receiving State or, if already in the receiving State, before entering on his duties with the consular post. In any such case, the sending State shall withdraw his appointment. In the cases mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article, the receiving State is not obliged to give to the sending State reasons for its decision. Article 24 Notification to the Receiving State of Appointments, Arrivals and Departures The Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the receiving State or the authority designated by that Ministry shall be notified of: the appointment of members of a consular post, their arrival after appointment to the consular post, their final departure or the termination of their functions and any other changes affecting their status that may occur in the course of their service with the consular post; the arrival and final departure of a person belonging to the family of a member of a consular post forming part of his household and, where appropriate, the fact that a person becomes or ceases to be such a member of the family; the arrival and final departure of members of the private staff and, where appropriate, the termination of their service as such; the engagement and discharge of persons resident in the receiving State as members of a consular post or as members of the private staff entitled to privileges and immunities.

Article 26 Departure From the Territory of the Receiving State The receiving State shall, even in case of armed conflict, grant to members of the consular post and members of the private staff, other than nationals of the receiving State, and to members of their families forming part of their households irrespective of nationality, the necessary time and facilities to enable them to prepare their departure and to leave at the earliest possible moment after the termination of the functions of the members concerned. In particular, it shall, in case of need, place at their disposal the necessary means of transport for themselves and their property other than property acquired in the receiving State the export of which is prohibited at the time of departure. Article 27 Protection of Consular Premises and Archives and of the Interests of the Sending State in Exceptional Circumstances In the event of the severance of consular relations between two States: the receiving State shall, even in case of armed conflict, respect and protect the consular premises, together with the property of the consular post and the consular archives;  the sending State may entrust the custody of the consular premises, together with the property contained therein and the consular archives, to a third State acceptable to the receiving State; the sending State may entrust the protection of its interests and those of its nationals to a third State acceptable to the receiving State. In the event of the temporary or permanent closure of a consular post, the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply. In addition, if the sending State, although not represented in the receiving State by a diplomatic mission, has another consular post in the territory of that State, that consular post may be entrusted with the custody of the premises of the consular post which has been closed, together with the property contained therein and the consular archives, and, with the consent of the receiving State, with the exercise of consular functions in the district of that consular post; or if the sending State has no diplomatic mission and no other consular post in the receiving State, the provisions of sub-paragraphs  and of paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply.

The national flag of the sending State may be flown and its coat-of-arms displayed on the building occupied by the consular post and at the entrance door thereof, on the residence of the head of the consular post and on his means of transport when used on official business. In the exercise of the right accorded by this Article regard shall be had to the laws, regulations and usages of the receiving State. Article 30  Accommodation The receiving State shall either facilitate the acquisition on its territory, in accordance with its laws and regulations, by the sending State of premises necessary for its consular post or assist the latter in obtaining accommodation in some other way. It shall also, where necessary, assist the consular post in obtaining suitable accommodation for its members. Article 31 Inviolability of the Consular Premises Consular premises shall be inviolable to the extent provided in this Article. The authorities of the receiving State shall not enter that part of the consular premises which is used exclusively for the purpose of the work of the consular post except with the consent of the head of the consular post or of his designee or of the head of the diplomatic mission of the sending State. The consent of the head of the consular post may, however, be assumed in case of fire or other disaster requiring prompt protective action. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, the receiving State is under a special duty to take all appropriate steps to protect the consular premises against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the consular post or impairment of its dignity. The consular premises, their furnishings, the property of the consular post and its means of transport shall be immune from any form of requisition for purposes of national defence or public utility. If expropriation is necessary for such purposes, all possible steps shall be taken to avoid impeding the performance of consular functions, and prompt, adequate and effective compensation shall be paid to the sending State. Article 32  Exemption From Taxation of Consular Premises Consular premises and the residence of the career head of consular post of which the sending State or any person acting on its behalf is the owner or lessee shall be exempt from all national, regional or municipal dues and taxes whatsoever, other than such as represent payment for specific services rendered. The exemption from taxation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to such dues and taxes if, under the law of the receiving State, they are payable by the person who contracted with the sending State or with the person acting on its behalf. Article 33 Inviolability of the Consular Archives and Documents The consular archives and documents shall be inviolable at all times and wherever they may be.

Article 35  Freedom of Communication The receiving State shall permit and protect freedom of communication on the part of the consular post for all official purposes. In communicating with the Government, the diplomatic missions and other consular posts, wherever situated, of the sending State, the consular post may employ all appropriate means, including diplomatic or consular couriers, diplomatic or consular bags and messages in code or cipher. However, the consular post may install and use a wireless transmitter only with the consent of the receiving State. The official correspondence of the consular post shall be inviolable. Official correspondence means all correspondence relating to the consular post and its functions. The consular bag shall be neither opened nor detained. Nevertheless, if the competent authorities of the receiving State have serious reason to believe that the bag contains something other than the correspondence, documents or articles referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, they may request that the bag be opened in their presence by an authorized representative of the sending State. If this request is refused by the authorities of the sending State, the bag shall be returned to its place of origin. The packages constituting the consular bag shall bear visible external marks of their character and may contain only official correspondence and documents or articles intended exclusively for official use. The consular courier shall be provided with an official document indicat ing his status and the number of packages constituting the consular bag.

A consular bag may be entrusted to the captain of a ship or of a commercial aircraft scheduled to land at an authorized port of entry. He shall be provided with an official document indicating the number of packages constituting the bag, but he shall not be considered to be a consular courier.

Article 36 Commication and Contact with Nationals of the Sending State With a view to facilitating the exercise of consular functions relating to nationals of the sending State: consular officers shall be free to communicate with nationals of the sending State and to have access to them. Nationals of the sending State shall have the same freedom with respect to communication with and access to consular officers of the sending State; if he so requests, the competent authorities of the receiving State shall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if, within its consular district, a national of that State is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner. Any communication addressed to the consular post by the person arrested, in prison, custody or detention shall also be forwarded by the said authorities without delay. The said authorities shall inform the person concerned without delay of his rights under this sub-paragraph;  consular officers shall have the right to visit a national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal representation. They shall also have the right to visit any national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention in their district in pursuance of a judgment. Nevertheless, consular officers shall refrain from taking action on behalf of a national who is in prison, custody or detention if he expressly opposes such action. The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations of the receiving State, subject to the proviso, however, that the said laws and regulations must enable full effect to be given to the purposes for which the rights accorded under this Article are intended. Article 37 Information in Cases of Deaths, Guarduabship or trusteeship, Wrecks and Air Accidents If the relevant information is available to the competent authorities of the receiving State, such authorities shall have the duty: in the case of the death of a national of the sending State, to inform without delay the consular post in whose district the death occurred; to inform the competent consular post without delay of any case where the appointment of a guardian or trustee appears to be in the interests of a minor or other person lacking full capacity who is a national of the sending State. The giving of this information shall, however, be without prejudice to the operation of the laws and regulations of the receiving State concerning such appointments; if a vessel, having the nationality of the sending State, is wrecked or runs aground in the territorial sea or internal waters of the receiving State, or if an aircraft registered in the sending State suffers an accident on the territory of the receiving State, to inform without delay the consular post nearest to the scene of the occurrence. Article 38 Communication With the Authorities of the Receiving State In the exercise of their functions, consular officers may address: the competent local authorities of their consular district;  the competent central authorities of the receiving State if and to the extent that this is allowed by the laws, regulations and usages of the receiving State or by the relevant international agreements. Article 39 Consular Fees and Charges The consular post may levy in the territory of the receiving State the fees and charges provided by the laws and regulations of the sending State for consular acts. The sums collected in the form of the fees and charges referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, and the receipts for such fees and charges, shall be exempt from all dues and taxes in the receiving State. End of Consular Functions Section II Facilities, Privileges and Immunities Relating to Career Consular Officers and other Members of a Consular Post Article 40 Protection of Consular Officers The receiving State shall treat consular officers with due respect and shall take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their person, freedom or dignity. Article 41 Personal Inviolability of Consular Officers Consular officers shall not be liable to arrest or detention pending trial, except in the case of a grave crime and pursuant to a decision by the competent judicial authority. Except in the case specified in paragraph 1 of this Article, consular officers shall not be committed to prison or liable to any other form of restriction on their personal freedom save in execution of a judicial decision of final effect. If criminal proceedings are instituted against a consular officer, he must appear before the competent authorities. Nevertheless, the proceedings shall be conducted with the respect due to him by reason of his official position and, except in the case specified in paragraph 1 of this Article, in a manner which will hamper the exercise of consular functions as little as possible. When, in the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article, it has become necessary to detain a consular officer, the proceedings against him shall be instituted with the minimum of delay. Article 42 Notification of Arrest, Detention or Prosecution In the event of the arrest or detention, pending trial, of a member of the consular staff, or of criminal proceedings being instituted against him, the receiving State shall promptly notify the head of the consular post. Should the latter be himself the object of any such measure, the receiving State shall notify the sending State through the diplomatic channel. Article 43  Immunity From Jurisdiction Consular officers and consular employees shall not be amenable to the jurisdiction of the judicial or administrative authorities of the receiving State in respect of acts performed in the exercise of consular functions. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not, however, apply in respect of a civil action either: arising out of a contract concluded by a consular officer or a consular employee in which he did not contract expressly or impliedly as an agent of the sending State; or  by a third party for damage arising from an accident in the receiving State caused by a vehicle, vessel or aircraft. Article 44 Liability to Give Evidence Members of a consular post may be called upon to attend as witnesses in the course of judicial or administrative proceedings. A consular employee or a member of the service staff shall not, except in the cases mentioned in paragraph 3 of this Article, decline to give evidence. If a consular officer should decline to do so, no coercive measure or penalty may be applied to him. The authority requiring the evidence of a consular officer shall avoid interference with the performance of his functions. It may, when possible, take such evidence at his residence or at the consular post or accept a statement from him in writing. Members of a consular post are under no obligation to give evidence concerning matters connected with the exercise of their functions or to produce official correspondence and documents relating thereto. They are also entitled to decline to give evidence as expert witnesses with regard to the law of the sending State. Article 45 Waiver of Privileges and Immunities The sending State may waive, with regard to a member of the consular post, any of the privileges and immunities provided for in Articles 41, 43 and 44. The waiver shall in all cases be express, except as provided in paragraph 3 of this Article, and shall be communicated to the receiving State in writing.  The initiation of proceedings by a consular officer or a consular employee in a matter where he might enjoy immunity from jurisdiction under Article 43 shall preclude him from invoking immunity from jurisdiction in respect of any counter-claim directly connected with the principal claim.  The waiver of immunity from jurisdiction for the purposes of civil or administrative proceedings shall not be deemed to imply the waiver of immunity from the measures of execution resulting from the judicial decisio n; in respect of such measures, a separate waiver shall be necessary. Article 46 Exemption From Registration of Aliens and Residence Permits  Consular officers and consular employees and members of their families forming part of their households shall be exempt from all obligations under the laws and regulations of the receiving State in regard to the registration of aliens and residence permits. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not, however, apply to any consular employee who is not a permanent employee of the sending State or who carries on any private gainful occupation in the receiving State or to any member of the family of any such employee. Article 47  Exemption From Work Permits  Members of the consular post shall, with respect to services rendered for the sending State, be exempt from any obligations in regard to work permits imposed by the laws and regulations of the receiving State concerning the employment of foreign labour.

Article 48  Social Security Exemption Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, members of the consular post with respect to services rendered by them for the sending State, and members of their families forming part of their households, shall be exempt from social security provisions which may be in force in the receiving State. The exemption provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply also to members of the private staff who are in the sole employ of members of the consular post, on condition: that they are not nationals of or permanently resident in the receiving State; and that they are covered by the social security provisions which are in force in the sending State or a third State. Members of the consular post who employ persons to whom the exemption provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article does not apply shall observe the obligations which the social security provisions of the receiving State impose upon employers. 4.

The States Parties to this Convention, Considering that the Charter of the United Nations is based  on the principles of the dignity and equality inherent in all  human beings, and that all Member States have pledged themselves  to take joint and separate action, in co-operation with the Organization,  for the achievement of one of the purposes of the United Nations  which is to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance  of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction  as to race, sex, language or religion, Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity  and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and  freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in  particular as to race, colour or national origin, Considering that all human beings are equal before the law  and are entitled to equal protection of the law against any discrimination  and against any incitement to discrimination, Considering that the United Nations has condemned colonialism  and all practices of segregation and discrimination associated  therewith, in whatever form and wherever they exist, and that  the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries  and Peoples of 14 December 1960 (General Assembly resolution  1514 (XV)) has affirmed and solemnly proclaimed the necessity  of bringing them to a speedy and unconditional end, Considering that the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination  of All Forms of Racial Discrimination of 20 November 1963 (General  Assembly resolution 1904 (XVIII)) solemnly affirms the necessity  of speedily eliminating racial discrimination throughout the  world in all its forms and manifestations and of securing understanding  of and respect for the dignity of the human person, Convinced that any doctrine of superiority based on racial  differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable,  socially unjust and dangerous, and that there is no justification  for racial discrimination, in theory or in practice, anywhere, Reaffirming that discrimination between human beings on the  grounds of race, colour or ethnic origin is an obstacle to friendly  and peaceful relations among nations and is capable of disturbing  peace and security among peoples and the harmony of persons living  side by side even within one and the same State, Convinced that the existence of racial barriers is repugnant  to the ideals of any human society, Alarmed by manifestations of racial discrimination still in  evidence in some areas of the world and by governmental policies  based on racial superiority or hatred, such as policies of apartheid,  segregation or separation, Resolved to adopt all necessary measures for speedily eliminating  racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations, and  to prevent and combat racist doctrines and practices in order  to promote understanding between races and to build an international  community free from all forms of racial segregation and racial  discrimination, Bearing in mind the Convention concerning Discrimination in  respect of Employment and Occupation adopted by the International  Labour Organisation in 1958, and the Convention against Discrimination  in Education adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific  and Cultural Organization in 1960, Desiring to implement the principles embodied in the United  Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Al l Forms of Racial  Discrimination and to secure the earliest adoption of practical  measures to that end, Have agreed as follows: PART I Article I 1.
